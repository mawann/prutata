        <h1>PRUTATA!</h1>

        <p>Tangerang, November 2, 2023.</p>

        <p>My son is three years old and enjoys watching YouTube frequently.
          Due to this, he has learned several English words such as Police Car,
          Ambulance, Bus, Fire Truck, and Excavator.
          But there are some words that he doesn't say correctly, like Yauwa for Yellow
          or Che-Che for Seven. Other than that, he knows the names of colors, numbers,
          and letters very well and speaks them clearly.</p>

        <p>However, today he kept saying "Prutata. Prutata." and I'm not sure what that means.
          I was sitting in front of my laptop and decided to search for "Prutata" on Google.
          Unfortunately, I couldn't find any websites related to this term other than
          the name of a song and a few personal social media accounts.</p>

        <p>Later, I followed up by searching on Whois and discovered that the domain
          name Prutata.com is currently unowned. Although the domain name is good, clear,
          and more straightforward than Google, people in Indonesia get confused if they
          should type <em>Gugel</em> instead. The domain name has only one extra character
          compared to Google, making it easy to remember.  Okay, I register this domain name now.
          Who knows, it might become costly in the future.
          Not bad, getting sustenance from a child's idea.</p>

        <p>Bing Chat states that Prutata is a slang language that translates to
          "This is really good and interesting!"</p>

        <p>The code for this page is on Github and stored on <em>Cloudflare Pages</em>, so I don't
        have to rent a server. All I have to do is buy a domain. 
        It's really that easy!</p>
